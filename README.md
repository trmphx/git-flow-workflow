# Git Flow Workflow

Git flow is a popular Git branching strategy aimed at simplifying release management, and was introduced by software developer Vincent Driessen in 2010. Fundamentally, Git flow involves isolating your work into different types of Git branches.

**_In the Git flow workflow, there are five different branch types:_**

- `main`/`master`
- `develop`
- `feature`
- `release`
- `hotfix`
